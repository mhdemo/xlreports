<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of xlreports is to create simple wrappers around the writexl::write_xlsx function that
makes it easier to export data frames into timestamped Excel files.

install.packages("xlreports")
``` -->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```
## Example

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(xlreports)

xlreports::report_export(tabs = list(cars = mtcars, air = airquality),
                                 export_dest = "tmp_folder",
                         fname = "cars_and_air")
